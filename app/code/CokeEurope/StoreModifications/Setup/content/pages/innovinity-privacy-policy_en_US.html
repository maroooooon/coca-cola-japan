    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy notice sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect about users of our website at [www.insert] (our &lt;strong&gt;site&lt;/strong&gt;) and how that information will be processed by us.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This privacy notice applies to: visitors to our site who do not register as well as those who do; any customers that purchase our goods and/or services from us via our site or otherwise; and all individual contractors and service providers who provide services to our business (&lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cocacola.co.uk is a &lt;strong&gt;data controller&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you, and for explaining this clearly to you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the using the details set out above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Please read this privacy notice carefully to understand what we do with your personal information and what rights you have in relation to our activities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is personal data and our lawful basis for processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Personal data, or personal information, means any information relating to an individual from which that person can be identified. There are special categories of more sensitive personal information which require a higher level of protection (see further at section 3.4, below).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Our principle lawful basis for processing is set out in the table below. However, some of our grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We may only rely on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) to process your personal information, if your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Where we rely on legitimate interests for our processing, we have set out the relevant interest, below.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data although, if you are a private individual, we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data we collect about you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We also collect, use and share &lt;strong&gt;Aggregated Data&lt;/strong&gt; such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Technical Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical and Public Social Media Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for two years after they cease being customers for tax purposes and for the purpose of any legal claims.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your rights below for further information.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You have the following rights:
    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to be told what we are doing with your personal information. We do this by providing you with this privacy notice;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to correct or update the personal information we hold about you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to object to the processing of your personal information;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to ask us to delete the information that we hold about you where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to ask us to stop processing your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground and where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to ask us to restrict how we use your personal information for a period of time if you claim that it is inaccurate and we want to verify the position or in some limited other circumstances;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to ask us to send your personal information to another organisation in a computer-readable format;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to complain to the Information Commissioner's office if you are unhappy with our use of your personal data: you can do this at &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/"&gt;https://ico.org.uk/concerns/&lt;/a&gt;. Do contact us straight away if you consider that we are not handling your personal information properly so we can try and sort the problem out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If we delete your personal information or restrict our use of it, we will not be able to provide our services to you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you want to exercise any of your rights, please contact privacy@coca-cola.com. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
